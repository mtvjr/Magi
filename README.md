# Magi - A Magic The Gathering Library for Rust

### Note: This library is a work in progress and may never reach a working or stable state.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mtvjr/magi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mtvjr/magi)

Magi is an attempt to implement a Magic the Gathering library for the rust programming language, while teaching me about
the language at the same time. Eventually, if I am happy with the progress, I will try to make a server, a client API,
and a client for the server.

This project is developed in my free time, so updates may come irregularly, if at all.

## Current Features
* An enum based Color System
* An enum based Mana System
* Tests for the above features
* Documentation for the above features

## Upcoming features
* A mana cost and payment system
* The start of a card type system

## Not coming for a while
* A playable game
* Implemented cards
* Server
* Client

## How can you help

This is a learning project for Rust for me, please let me know if you see anything that is not "rust-like" in
implementation. I haven't decided if I'm going to accept pull requests yet, due to the small scale of the project, but
that may change with time.
